**TFOC Launcher** is a launcher designed to enhance the gaming experience in our favorite game Transformers: Fall of Cybertron.

# What's in here?
1. **Discord RPC:** The ability to see what the player is doing: Sitting in the Launcher, or playing on some map.
2. **Easy installation of mods (So far, only the installation of Coalesced):** With this launcher we can easily install mods.
3. **Our favorite splash:** For the sake of this originally created this launcher (At that time, just a mod). When we start the game, we will be able to see our splash.

And that's just the beginning! In the future, there will be new features and functions, so - wait, use the Launcher, and just enjoy the game!
