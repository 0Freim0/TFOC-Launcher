**TFOC Launcher** is a launcher designed to enhance the gaming experience in our favorite game Transformers: Fall of Cybertron.
I know it doesn't look particularly cool, it's not made in the best way, and a lot of people can do better, but, this project was made purely for fun to see if something like this would work and exist at all, so yeah.

# What's in here?
1. **Discord RPC:** Now, in discord we can see - Whether the player is in the lobby, whether there is a vote, and on what map he is playing.
2. **Easy installation of mods (So far, only the installation of Coalesced):** With this launcher we can easily install mods.
3. **Our favorite splash:** For the sake of this originally created this launcher (At that time, just a mod). When we start the game, we will be able to see our splash.

And that's not all! In the future, the Launcher will be upgraded to Multi-game Launcher. 
With it, you will be able to run other Transformers games (e.g. WFC, RotDS, ROTF)! Also, and in them will be simplified installation of mods, and Discord RPC!
